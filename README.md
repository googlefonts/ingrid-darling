# Ingrid Darling

Ingrid Darling is a cute script font originally created for greeting cards. It is based on a cursive hand writing style that has a playful, whimsical appeal. It would be best served as a display font and should be used sparingly rather than in larger bodies of type.

## Building the Fonts

The font is built using fontmake and gftools post processing script. Tools are all python based, so it must be previously installed.

To install all the Python tools into a virtualenv, do the following:

From terminal:

```

cd your/local/project/directory

#once in the project folder create a virtual environment. 
This step has to be done just once, the first time:

python3 -m venv venv

#activate the virtual environment

source venv/bin/activate

#install the required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Then run the this command:

```
cd sources
gftools builder config.yml
```
